## Overview

This project is designed as a comprehensive study tool for understanding Java Web technologies, including Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It uses a fun and interactive horoscope theme to apply and demonstrate these concepts in a real-world scenario.

## Educational Objectives

- **Understanding Servlets:** Learn how to handle HTTP requests and responses using Java Servlets.
- **Exploring JSP:** Discover how to create dynamic web pages with JavaServer Pages.
- **Implementing MVC Architecture:** Gain insight into designing applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern for a clear separation of concerns.
- **Database Integration:** Practice connecting your Java Web application with a database for storing and retrieving data.

## Key Concepts

- Servlet Lifecycle
- JSP Syntax and Directives
- JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL)
- MVC Design Pattern
- JDBC and Database Connectivity
